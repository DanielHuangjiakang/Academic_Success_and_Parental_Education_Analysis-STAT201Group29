# Academic Success and Parental Education Level Analysis
# STAT201-Group-Project_29

## Introduction

Investigating the factors that influence academic grades is crucial for understanding educational outcomes and addressing inequalities. This repository contains a research project that focuses on the relationship between students' academic success and the education level of their parents.

### Background

Several studies have highlighted the correlation between parental education levels and student academic performance, which can impact graduation rates and reflect educational inequalities. This project utilizes a dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), comprising 31 factors related to the academic achievements of 145 students, with a particular emphasis on parental characteristics.

### Significance

The analysis aims to shed light on the impact of parental education levels on student GPA, thereby contributing to the broader conversation on education policy and family engagement in academic success.

## Methods

We categorized students into two groups: those from high-education families and those from low-education families, based on whether at least one parent holds a university degree. We defined academic success as achieving a GPA above 3.0. Our hypotheses for the statistical test are:

```latex
H_0: p_h - p_l = 0
H_A: p_h - p_l â‰  0
