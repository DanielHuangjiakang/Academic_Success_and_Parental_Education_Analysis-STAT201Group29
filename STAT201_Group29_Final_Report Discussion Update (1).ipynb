    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Investigating the factors that affect students' academic grades is a crucial area of research with significant implications for educational institutions, policymakers, and society as a whole. Understanding these factors can help us estimate educational outcomes for students. Several published journals and studies highlight the importance of this research area. One of these aspects is their impact on graduation rates. A study by Pascarella and Terenzini (2005) emphasizes that academic performance is a strong predictor of whether a student will complete their degree. Furthermore, investigating these factors can make us aware of educational inequalities. [A research paper by Reardon (2011) ](https://cepa.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/reardon%20whither%20opportunity%20-%20chapter%205.pdf) claims that students from different socioeconomic backgrounds often face disparities in academic achievement. Last but not least, Makewa et al.(2012) propose that parents might also have an impact on students' grades. To conduct further investigation, we obtained a dataset from UCI. This dataset considers 31 factors related to the academic success of 145 students, with a specific focus on the education level of students' parents. The students will be sorted based on whether they come from highly educated families (where at least one parent has gone to university) or not. By analyzing the data, we can accurately gauge students' academic success by examining their parents' educational background, with the criterion being that the student achieved a GPA exceeding 3 in the previous semester.\n",

    "## Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "In our study, we aimed to assess the academic success of individual students by examining their parents' education levels. We categorized students into two groups: those from high-education families and those from low-education families. We defined a high-education family as one where at least one parent holds a university degree. To determine academic success, we utilized the students' last semester GPA, considering a GPA above 3.0 as a benchmark for academic achievement. We decided on this metric because we felt like it denoted a good threshhold for which students are perceived as acedemically successful. Our data came from UC Irvine, which is considered a top University in the US, so students with a 3.0 GPA or higher are clearly achieving a level of academic success as indicated by their grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our initial analysis, we found that there were a large enough amount of students in each level of family education for the analysis to be appropriate. Additionally, we found that the proportions for our sample were really similar for each group. However, this is not enough to conclusively say that the education level of the family doesn't make a difference. Our sample size is relatively small, even in comparison to the entire UC Irvine student population, not to mention the entire population. Furthermore, our analysis does not provide insights into the accuracy of our results. Therefore, additional analyses are necessary to delve deeper into the relationship between family education level and academic success.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the relationship between our two variaables, we will first coduct a hypothesis test by using boostrapping method. We will use $p_h$ to denote the proportion of students from high education families and $p_l$ to denote the proportion from low education families. Our hypotheses are as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_0: p_h - p_l = 0, H_A: p_h - p_l \\neq 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In our hypothesis test, we will use $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further examine the relationship between our variables, we will employ a theory-based method to obtain an additional p-value. This approach will provide stronger evidence to support our conclusion and determine which group has a higher chance of academic success."

    "## Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In our study, we aimed to assess the academic success of individual students by examining their parents' education levels.\n",
    "From the analysis that we did, we received a p-value of **1** and **0.9197** using different methods. Since we are using a significance level of **0.05** we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ using both of these methods. This implies that we fail to conclude that the academic success of an individual is influenced by their parents' education level. This is inline from our initial analysis where we did not notice a significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our findings also challenge the common stereotype and public perception regarding the correlation between parental education levels and a child's educational achievements. This is an interesting finding as it could potentially help combat discrimination amongst students with different parental education levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we fail to reject the null hypothesis it does not necessarilly mean that we accept the null hypothesis, rather our study can be further improved by increasing our sample size by surverying more students as well as expanding the range where we get our data and sampling from different schools/universities. These improvements would allow our data to be more representative of our intended population, reducing bias and would provide a more rigorous analysis. Moreover, an article by Vasich (2023) showed that UCI is highly ranked in terms of social mobility and graduation rate for people who received financial assistance which is typically associated with students with lower parental education level. This could imply that UCI is aware of the association between parental education level and students' success and that they have handled the situation very well. If this is true, then our further improvements of branching out to different schools/universities would provide insightful data regarding this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further questions that arise from this findings are whether or not different variables aside from parental education plays a role in affecting a student's academic performance. Other questions include whether this issue can be found in other universities aside from UCI. These questions in itself can be investigated with similar methods to what we did."
