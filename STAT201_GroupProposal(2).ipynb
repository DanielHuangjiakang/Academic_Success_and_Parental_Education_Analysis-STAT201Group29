    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Investigating the factors that affect students' academic grades is a crucial area of research with significant implications for educational institutions, policymakers, and society as a whole. Understanding these factors can help us estimate educational outcomes for students. Several published journals and studies highlight the importance of this research area. One of these aspects is their impact on graduation rates. A study by Pascarella and Terenzini (2005) emphasizes that academic performance is a strong predictor of whether a student will complete their degree. Furthermore, investigating these factors can make us aware of educational inequalities. [A research paper by Reardon (2011) ](https://cepa.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/reardon%20whither%20opportunity%20-%20chapter%205.pdf) claims that students from different socioeconomic backgrounds often face disparities in academic achievement. Last but not least, Makewa et al.(2012) propose that parents might also have an impact on students' grades. To conduct further investigation, we obtained a dataset from UCI. This dataset considers 31 factors related to the academic success of 145 students, with a specific focus on the education level of students' parents. The students will be sorted based on whether they come from highly educated families (where at least one parent has gone to university) or not. By analyzing the data, we can effectively assess students' academic success based on their parents' education level.\n",

    "## Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our research, we decided to compare the academic success of an individual student with the education level of their parents. to do this we sepearated each student into two groups: High education families and low education families. We determined that a high education family is one in which either parent has a university degree. To measure academic success, we used the students' last semester GPA. We determined that an academically successful student was one who had a GPA of above 3.0. We decided on this metric because we felt like it denoted a good threshhold for which students are perceived as acedemically successful. Our data came from UC Irvine, which is considered a top University in the US, so students with a 3.0 GPA or higher are clearly achieving a level of academic success as indicated by their grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our initial analysis, we found that there were a large enough amount of students in each level of family education for the analysis to be appropriate. Additionally, we found that the proportions for our sample were really similar for each group. However, this is not enough to conclusively say that the education level of the family doesn't make a difference. Our sample is relatively small compared to the overall population we are interested in, that of all students at UC Irvine. Additionally, our analysis doesn't provide information on the accuracy of our result. Therefore, additional analysis must be conducted to further explore the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the relationship between our two variaables, we will first coduct a hypothesis test. We will use $p_h$ to denote the proportion of students from high education families and $p_l$ to denote the proportion from low education families. Our hypotheses are as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_0: p_h - p_l = 0 \\\\\n",
    "H_A: p_h - p_l \\neq 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In our hypothesis test, we will use $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further compare the relationship between our variables we will use bootstrapping to obtain a confidence interval for the difference between the two proportions. This will help us determine whether there is a difference, how extreme the difference is, and which group has a higher chance for academic success."
